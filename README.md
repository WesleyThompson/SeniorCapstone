Cosmic Jam Battle is a free-for-all, multiplayer game. Each player assimilates anything they roll over gaining size in relation to the size of the object rolled up. The players will begin as small motes of slime and roll up progressively larger items until they are absorbing whole buildings and trees. A player who is significantly smaller than another player, can steal undigested objects if within a specified distance. The player with the largest total size after 5 minutes wins.
